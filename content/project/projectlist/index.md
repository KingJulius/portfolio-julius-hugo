## <a href ="https://github.com/KingJulius/Predict-that-Dish"> Predict that Dish </a>

Developed a full stack web application to classify images uploaded by the user as food dishes using React and Flask and trained the
Neural Network using the TensorFlow Library.

Deployed the application to the AWS EC2 instance and configured the reverse proxy server to handle HTTP requests to the server.

***

## <a href ="https://github.com/KingJulius/Minesweeper"> Minesweeper Application </a>

Designed an application using a client/server architecture to load and save an instance of the game and to display the top scores.

Engineered a multi-threaded connection handler on the server to distribute concurrent clients over a TCP socket and implemented
the design using JavaFX and Swing.

## <a href ="https://github.com/KingJulius/Real-Time-Digit-Classification"> Digit Classification using Real-Time Image Feed </a>
 
 Constructed a Digit classifier using a Convolution Neural Network architecture and trained using the MNIST database of handwritten digits to achieve a test accuracy of approximately 95% using real-time input feed.

 ## <a href ="https://github.com/KingJulius/Analogy-Generation-Using-Pre-Trained-Language-Models"> Analogy Generation Using Deep Learning </a>

Implemented Pruning Defence learnt in Machine Learning for Cyber Security. The Channels in the Final Pooling Layer have been pruned in decreasing order of their average activation values across the entire validation dataset. The Models that have been saved are the repaired models when accuracy drops by at least 10%.

On top of this, a GoodNet has been designed which combines the bad model and the repaired model for each of the 3 cases and we then compare the Accuracy and Attack Success Rate between the pruned models and the good nets.

To generate analogies by leveraging Natural Language Generation (NLG) models to produce valid target-word explanations with increasing levels of abstraction and analogation through restricting vocabulary sets, akin to the popular party game Taboo.
